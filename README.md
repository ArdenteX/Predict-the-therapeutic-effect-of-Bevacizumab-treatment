# Abstract
One of the malignancies with the highest mortality rates among women worldwide is ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian
cancer is the most common kind of ovarian cancer (EOC), it takes ~90% of ovarian cancer patients. peritoneal serous
surface papillary carcinoma (PSPC) is rare cancer whose incident rate is 7% in women[13]. Bevacizumab has been used
as a monotherapy along with chemotherapy to treat advanced EOC and PSPC. Bevacizumab has a significant effect on
chemotherapy, however, due to the high cost and side effects of the bevacizumab, how to predict the therapeutic effect of
Bevacizumab treatment is very important. In this paper, the author uses the proposed attention module, ECA, embedding
to the ResNet, compose as ECA-Net, to predict the bevacizumab in current tissue is effective or invalid through the
histopathological image. As a result, the ECA-Net gained novel performance, scoring highly on a number of evaluation
metrics. Specifically, the classification accuracy of the ECA-Net is 94.54% and the f1 score is 95.00%. keywords: ovarian, efficient channel attention, histopathological image, bevacizumab, stain normalization, epithelial
